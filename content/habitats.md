Hyperthetical is exploring experimental housing solutions designed to adapt to changing environmental conditions, particularly those related to climate change. Our goal is to create practical and resilient housing that can withstand the challenges of a changing world.

With the goal of prioritizing adaptability, energy efficiency, and sustainability, we believe there are new solutions to longstanding problems. We are exploring new materials, new construction methods, and new ways of living that can help us thrive in a world of change.

In addition to our work in housing, Hyperthetical is also involved in creating immersive installations and art pieces for the Burning Man festival. This allows us to explore creative and artistic expressions while pushing the boundaries of design and sustainability. We invite you to join us on this journey of innovation and creativity, where practical solutions and artistic expression come together to shape a better future.
